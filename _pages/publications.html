      <h2>《Geometric-based Passive Azimuth Localization Model Applied in Drone Flight》</h2>
      <p class="research-focus"><strong>Research Focus:</strong> To achieve pure azimuth passive localization for effective adjustment of related drones in a formation. This study is based on geometric principles, classifies and discusses various potential scenarios, and establishes a corresponding pure azimuth passive localization model. A solution for position adjustment is also proposed.</p>
      <p class="contribution"><strong>Personal Contribution:</strong> Utilized rigorous geometric derivations to analyze and categorize different scenarios; proposed a pure azimuth passive localization model, providing a theoretical foundation for drone formation localization; developed multiple position adjustment strategies to meet the practical needs of formation flight; conducted error analysis to assess the precision and reliability of the localization model; ultimately completed the first draft of the paper as the first author.</p>

      <h2>《National Reserve Resource Allocation Analysis and Policy Formulation》</h2>
      <p class="research-focus"><strong>Research Focus:</strong> Used the ARIMA time series model for data forecasting and applied the second-order difference method to measure the effects of specific policies before and after their implementation. The project also involved using differential equations to describe population growth trends and improved the visualization of population changes before and after policy implementation, based on actual conditions.</p>
      <p class="contribution"><strong>Personal Contribution:</strong> Extensively read English literature to determine the research direction and collected relevant data; contributed to paper writing and revisions.</p>
