I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [School of Cyber Science and Engineering University](https://cyber.qfnu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Qufu Normal University](https://www.qfnu.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hui Song](https://cyber.qfnu.edu.cn/info/1239/2571.htm) . During my four years of undergraduate studies, under the guidance of Professor Song, I enjoyed participating in mathematical modeling competitions and guiding my junior brothers or sisters to participate in such competitions.

I am honored to have obtained the qualification to pursue graduate studies without examination in September 2023.  I will enter the [College of computer science and technology](https://computer.upc.edu.cn/)) ,[China University of Petroleum (East China)](https://www.upc.edu.cn/) in September 2024 and work under the guidance of [Prof. Mingwen Shao](https://computer.upc.edu.cn/2017/0313/c6287a103909/page.htm)  My research interest includes Computer Vision (more challenging 3D reconstruction, 3D mesh, etc.), cross modal analysis, embodied intelligence, theoretical computing, and semantic segmentation.

Research Interests:Computer Vision, Multimodal Analysis,3D mesh,Theoretical Computing, Semantic Segmentation

Research Skills: Proficient in theoretical derivation and proof; solid foundation in academic writing; keen interest in interdisciplinary fields, adept at integrating knowledge across disciplines.

[Highlight] I am looking for a PhD position in artificial intelligence or interdisciplinary fields starting in the fall of 2026. If you have any clues, please contact me!

# Research Interests

* **Computer Vision**  
Currently, I am focused on tackling more challenging 3D reconstruction problems based on 3D Gaussian Splatting technology, as well as semantic segmentation of 3D meshes and multimodal fusion. I remain dedicated to the development of embodied intelligence, exploring how to enable intelligent agents to perceive and reason about the visual world more accurately. I aspire to contribute to the realization of intelligent agents truly mastering world models.

* **Theoretical Modeling and Computation**  
As a Bayesian, and building on the knowledge gained from my undergraduate studies in mathematical modeling, I firmly believe that most systems can be effectively represented by dynamic probabilistic models within an acceptable error range. Therefore, I continue to focus on research areas such as multivariate analysis, dynamic modeling, system modeling and simulation, and evaluation systems.
