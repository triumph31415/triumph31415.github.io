I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [School of Cyber Science and Engineering University](https://cyber.qfnu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Qufu Normal University](https://www.qfnu.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hui Song](https://cyber.qfnu.edu.cn/info/1239/2571.htm) . During my four years of undergraduate studies, under the guidance of Professor Song, I enjoyed participating in mathematical modeling competitions and guiding my junior brothers or sisters to participate in such competitions.

I am honored to have obtained the qualification to pursue graduate studies without examination in September 2023.  I will enter the [College of computer science and technology](https://computer.upc.edu.cn/)) ,[China University of Petroleum (East China)](https://www.upc.edu.cn/) in September 2024 and work under the guidance of [Prof. Mingwen Shao](https://computer.upc.edu.cn/2017/0313/c6287a103909/page.htm)  My research interest includes Computer Vision (more challenging 3D reconstruction, 3D mesh, etc.), cross modal analysis, embodied intelligence, theoretical computing, and semantic segmentation.
